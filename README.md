# React Random Quote Generator

## Introduction

The goal was to create an application that will retrieve quotes from the API, which will display a random quotation.

Additionally I created a button that will allow to draw the next random quote and a button that will allow to return to the previous quote.

## Technologies

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   React 17.0.2
-   Axios 0.24.0

```
$ cd ../random-quote-generator

$ npm start
```
